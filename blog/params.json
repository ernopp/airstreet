{"name":"Nathan Benaich","tagline":"Technology venture capital investor","body":"### About me\r\nI joined [Playfair Capital](http://playfaircapital.com) in 2013 and focus on consumer and enterprise technology-enabled investments, specifically deal sourcing, due diligence, and ongoing portfolio support. I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, infrastructure-as-a-service, mobile-first on-demand consumer apps, enterprise productivity software, as well as genomics. Within the portfolio, I focus on product design, analytics, and growth, while providing support for companies raising their next round of financing.\r\n \r\nAt Playfair, I've originated or participated in seed, Series A and Series B investments for high-growth companies including [Mapillary](http://mapillary.com), [Appear Here](http://appearhere.co.uk), [Dojo](http://dojoapp.co), and [Festicket](http://festicket.com). Prior to Playfair, I earned an M.Phil and Ph.D in oncology as a Gates and Dr. Herchel Smith Scholar at the University of Cambridge, and a BA in biology from Williams College. I've published research focused on technologies to halt the fatal spread of cancer around the body.\r\n \r\nHit me up via Twitter [@nathanbenaich](http://twitter.com/nathanbenaich) and [@playfaircapital](http://twitter.com/playfaircapital).\r\n","google":"UA-41373361-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
